    "Before, we built a model to predict emergency department (ED) visits anchored on treatment dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with that is the primary physicians do not interact with their patients during their treatment sessions. They only meet during their clinic visits. That is the best time for the model to nudge the physician for an intervention. Thus, we now want to build a model to predict patient's risk of ED visits prior to clinic date instead of prior to treatment session.\n",
